Updated to run on Python3. You will also have to ensure that your Ref:XX folder has rw permissions. My small contribution.

xenserver_to_xen
================
  This project is for migrating from xenserver `*.xva` image to xen `*.img` image.

### Quickstart
1. Untar your xenserver image {{image}} with the command: `tar -xvf {image}.xva`. There are Ref:XX folder and ova.xml, where Ref:XX which contains 1MB size chunks of the image disk and ova.xml represents image spec.

2. Then grab this handy utility and run it on your untared data, as an example:
>    python xenmigrate.py â€“-convert=Ref:XX {image}.img

3. If you'd like to convert `{image}.img` to `{image}.qcow2`, you can run the command:
>    qemu-img convert -f raw -O qcow2 {image}.img {image}.qcow2
